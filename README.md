A decentralized fast-finality blockchain for interoperable payment channel networks.

Providing a base layer currency to settle interoperable payments at high throughput. Leveraging fast finality to allow short cross currency channel timeouts. Proof of stake to provide performance and effective light clients. Payment channels to enable high volume low value transfers at realistic throughput. Streaming credit payments for effective routing and interoperability across chains.

Proudly building on the work of [Cosmos](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) and [Interledger](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs).
