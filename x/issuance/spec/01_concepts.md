# Concepts

The issuance mechanism in this module is designed to allow a trusted party to issue an asset on to the Kava blockchain. The issuer has sole discretion over the minting and redemption (burning) of the asset, as well as restricting access to the asset via asset seizure. The functionality of this module is similar to that of ERC-20 contracts for stablecoins that have a single issuer.
