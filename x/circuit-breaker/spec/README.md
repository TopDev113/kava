## Overview

The `x/groupgov` module is an additional governance module to `cosmos-sdk/x/gov`. It allows groups of accounts to vote on and enact proposals, mainly to allow certain proposal types to be decided on quickly in emergency situations, or to delegate low risk parameter updates to a smaller group of individuals.

Groups have permissions.
