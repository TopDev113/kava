### How can I earn money on Kava?
**Staking**  
Like most Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains, KAVA holders can ‘stake’ their KAVA by either running a validator node themselves or by ‘bonding’ their tokens to a third party that is running a node. Bonding temporarily locks in your coins for a 21-day.

**Tips**  
Keep a small amount of KAVA in your wallet in case you want to include a fee.  
  
Avoid having a CDP liquidated by monitoring the collateral value, debt value, and liquidation price. If the collateral value drops below the liquidation price, your position will be liquidated. Assets from liquidated CDP’s are put up for auction. If that happens, the auction typically takes 8-24 hours and you can expect ~⅓ of the collateral back (not guaranteed).  
  
Some exchanges (like Binance) require a memo field for cross-chain transfers. If a memo is not included, those funds can be lost.
### How can I send assets to Kava? 
To use assets on Kava, first move those assets to the Binance Chain (not Binance Smart Chain) and then to the Kava Chain.  
  
This [guide](https://medium.com/kava-labs/borrow-usdx-on-kavas-web-app-using-trust-wallet-8540ba61f7a4) walks you through the process.
### Do Kava transactions require fees? 
Fees are optional. They can be included if the network becomes busy, and can be added to prioritize a transaction to complete faster.
### Do Kava transactions require gas? 
All transactions on the Kava blockchain consume gas.  
  
The amount of gas consumed is proportional to the amount of computation and state access that the transaction requires.  
  
For large and/or complex transactions, users may have to increase the amount of gas that the transaction requests above the default value.
